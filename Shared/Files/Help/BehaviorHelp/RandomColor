## RandomColor

*RandomColor* writes a random color into a Float4 variable. The color is computed by this forumula:

color(t) = a + b * cos[ 2Ï€(c * t + d)]

The cosine oscilates c times with a phase of d. The result is scaled and biased by a and b to meet the desired constrast and brightness.

For further information and example values please have a look at the following article **https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/palettes/palettes.htm**

Syntax:

`RandomColor<Variable: Float4Variable><A: Float3Value><B: Float3Value><C: Float3Value><D: Float3Value>`
