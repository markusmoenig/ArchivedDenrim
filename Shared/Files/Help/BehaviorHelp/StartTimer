## StartTimer

**StartTimer** is similar to **Call** in that it invokes / calls another behavior tree. The difference is that **StartTimer** starts a timer and calls the tree in certain time intervals.

Syntax:

`Call<Tree: TreeName><Interval: InSeconds`

Example:

`Call<Tree: enemy.createEnemy><Interval: 0.2>`

Would call the createEnemy tree of the enemy id every 0.2 seconds.

Optional Parameter:

* **Once** (true/false), if true will call the tree only once. The default is false.
