## GetTouchPos

*GetTouchPos* returns *Success* if a touch operation is in progress, which means that on macOS the left mouse button is pressed or on iOS that the user is touching the display, otherwise the node returns *Failure*.

Additionally, if a touch operation is in progress, *GetTouchPos* will write the position into a variable.

Syntax:

`GetTouchPos<Variable: VariableName>`

VariableName has to be a *Float2* variable.
