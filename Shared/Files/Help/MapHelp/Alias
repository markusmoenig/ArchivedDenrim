## Alias

An **Alias** is a reference to an image or to a given sub-brect of an image (a tile). Aliases are used to describe tile sets in layers and are very powerful as you can specify attributes like repetition for an alias.

Basic Syntax:

`ID = Alias<Id: ImageId>`

Note that aliases IDs have to be two digits, like FS.

Aliases can have various options:

* **RepeatX** (true/false), repeats the alias horizontally.

* **RepeatY** (true/false), repeats the alias vertically.

* **Scale** ("Full"), scales the image up to the full canvas size, useful for background images.
