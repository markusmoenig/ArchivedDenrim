## Image

An **Image** references an image in an image group inside Denrim. When you import image(s) an image group is automatically created.

If you imported several images to an image group (by multi-selecting images during import or by adding new images later to the group), each image will have an enumerated index starting with 0.

Syntax:

`image = Image<Group: "GroupName"><Index: 0>`

The index paramater is optional and is 0 by default.
