## Sequence

A **Sequence** is similar to an **Image** references, however it does not describe a single image but a range of images in the image group. Sequences are just to create animations in Denrim.

Syntax:

`sequence = Sequence<Group: "GroupName"><Range: 0, 2>`

The range parameter defines the start and end index of images in the given animation group.

Optional Parameters:

* **Interval** (Float) defines the time interval between images in the sequence in seconds. The default value is 0.1. Increasing the interval will play the animation slower, smaller values will play it faster.
