## LoadMap

Loads a map with the given name and path. All assets inside the map are loaded relative to the path (folder) the is map is located in.

Example:

`LoadMap<Name: "Player/Map">`

Would load the map 'Map' from the Player folder. References to assets inside the map would also be relative to the Player folder.
