## CanvasSize

This command defines the canvas (the game area) for a given device name. Coordinates inside Map files are relative (between 0..100) to the current canvas size.

For example if the current device has a canvas size of 800, 800 a coordinate of 50, 50 would be 400, 400.

Using relative coordinates to device specific canvas sizes allows Denrim to:

1. Scale all graphics seamlessly as the coordinates for shapes are relative to the canvas size.
2. Allows the user to specify different canvas sizes for specific devices as devices may have different aspect ratios.
