## Calls

Calls the given behavior tree.

Syntax:

`Call<Tree: TreeName>`

Example:

`Call<Tree: game.gameOver>`

Optionally you can pass a series of variables to the call, the tree has to receive these variables in the same order.

For example you would like to send the ballPos and ballRadius variables to the player's checkForHit tree, you can send them like this:

`Call<Tree: player.checkForHit><Variables: ballPos, ballRadius>`

and the tree would receive them like this:

`tree "checkForHit" Float2<ballPos>Float<ballRadius>`
