## CreateInstance2D

*CreateInstance2D* creates a new on demand instance for a given instancer id at the given position. The instancer id has to be created using *OnDemandInstance2D* in the corresponding map file.

Note that a new shape / behavior pair is created for each instance and each reference to the shape id from the behavior file will reference the correct instance. You can destroy an instance using *DestroyInstance2D*.

On demand instances are very usefil to create temporary objects, like missiles / bullets / enemy ships etc.

Syntax:

`CreateInstance2D<Id: InstancerId><Position: Float2Value>`
