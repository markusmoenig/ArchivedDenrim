## Layer

A **Layer** contains visual data like shapes, shaders and tile aliases. Layers are combined into a **Scene**.

There are two different ways to construct a Layer, first is to list the shapes and shaders which should be displayed in this layer:

`layer = Layer<Shaders: ..><Shapes: ..>`

The second way is to construct a tile set for the layer using an empty Layer<> statement and start the following lines with : followed by the aliases. See the examples.

Other options:

* **Scroll** (Float2) defines a relative scroll value by which the layer is scrolled per update. This is useful for automatic scrolling backgrounds.

* **Offset** (Float2) is the offset into the scene for this layer. Normally a scene would start drawing a layer starting with (0, 0), using the Offset option you can define where in the scene the layer should be drawn.

* **ClipToCanvas** (true/false), if true all shapes or other visual data drawn in the layer will be clipped to the canvas, i.e. draw operations only work inside the canvas. Default is false (no clipping).
