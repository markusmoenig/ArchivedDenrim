## ShapeContactCount

*ShapeContactCount* returns *Success* if the given shape id is controlled by physics and writes the amount of contacts (collisions) of the shape into an Int variable. Useful if you want to quickly check if a collision occured without being interested in exactly which shape collided.

Syntax:

`ShapeContactCount<Variable: IntVariableName><ShapeId: ShapeId>`
