## while

Conditionally executes the controlled nodes as long as a given boolean variable is true.

while ignores the return values of nodes and only focuses on the state of the variable. Use *Set* to change the boolean variable value at any time to stop execution.

Syntax:

`while hasNotBeenHit`

`while not hasNotBeenHit`

If you insert **not** after the while statement while will execute the controlled nodes as long as hasNotBeenHit is false.
