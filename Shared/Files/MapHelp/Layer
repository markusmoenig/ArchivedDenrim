A Layer contains visual data like shapes, shaders and tile aliases. Layers are combined into a Scene.

There are two different ways to construct a Layer, first is to list the shapes and shaders which should be displayed in this layer:

layer = Layer<Shaders: .., ..><Shapes: .., ..>

The second way is to construct a tile set for the layer using this syntax:

layer = Layer<>
: LISI..
: SI..

where LI and SI are aliases for tiles.

Other options:

Scroll (Float2) defines a relative scroll value by which the layer is scrolled per update. This is useful for automatic scrolling backgrounds.

Offset (Float2) is the offset into the scene for this layer. Normally a scene would start drawing a layer starting with (0, 0), using the Offset option you can define where in the scene the layer should be drawn.
