## Shader

A **Shader** creates a reference to a given shader in Denrim.

Basic Syntax:

`shaderId = Shader<Name: "ShaderName">`

You can optionally bind a behavior to the shader via <BehaviorId: BehaviorId>, the shader will than have access to all the variables of the given behavior, see the shader documentation.
