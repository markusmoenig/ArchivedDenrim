## MoveTo2D

Moves a point in 2D space towards a destination point. Mostly used to move a shape towards a given coordinate or the current touch position.

Can be used either directly on the position of a shape if you control it manually or to set the velocity of a physics shape via *SetLinearVelocity2D*.

Syntax:

`MoveTo2D<Variable: Float2Value><Destination: Flot2Value>`

The variable will be updated with the new position.

Options:

* **Step** (Float), defines the step size towards the destination, the default value is 1.0.
