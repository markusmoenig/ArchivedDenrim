## SetScene

*SetScene* invokes / starts a scene in a given map file. A scene can be anything, a menu or a level inside a game. There can only be one scene active at once.

Normally the "init" tree in the *Game* behavior file would invoke the first scene in a game.

Syntax:

`SetScene<Map: "MapName"><SceneId: SceneId>`
