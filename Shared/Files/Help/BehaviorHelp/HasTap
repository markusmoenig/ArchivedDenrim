## HasTap

*HasTap* returns *Success* if a tap operation is in progress, otherwise the node returns *Failure*.

A tap operation means the following:

* **iOS**: The user has tapped the display. This can be in parallel to an ongoing touch operation, for example if you use the current touch position to move the position of a space ship, a tap is independent of the ongoing touch operation and can be for example used to fire a missile.
* **macOS**: Always returns .Failure

Syntax:

`HasTap<>`
