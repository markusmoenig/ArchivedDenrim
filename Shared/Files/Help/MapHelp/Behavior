## Behavior

**Behavior** references a behavior file inside Denrim by name.

Behavior files contain behavior trees (functions) and variables which can be bound to shape properties.

When initializing a new **Scene** the "init" tree of every behavior is called. The "update" tree is called for every refresh (every frame) during execution.

Syntax:

`behavior = Behavior<Name: "BehaviorName">`
