# Introduction

Denrim is a unique game creator for the Apple Metal ecosystem (macOS, iOS, tvOS). It uses a unique text based approach to describe everything you need for a 2D game, the basic building blocks are *map* and *behavior* files.

## Map Files

You can import resources like images and audio files and reference them in *Map* files, along with various other metadata you need for your game (like shapes and shaders). The ultimate output of a map file is a scene, which references all layered visual data.

## Behavior Trees

*Behavior* files assign behavior to game objects using easy to use, text based behavior trees. Behavior files and map files interact, as any data inside a map file can be bound to a variable in a behavior tree.

## Shaders

Metal shaders can be live coded in Denrim and shader variables can be automatically bound to behavior trees variables, making it very easy to sync the visual output of shaders to your game logic.
