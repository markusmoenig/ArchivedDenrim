## IsButtonDown

*IsButtonDown* will return *Success* if a given button on your Siri / Apple TV remote is currently pressed or *Failure* if not. Use *IsKeyDown* to check if a button on your keyboard is down. On non Apple TV devices this node always returns *Failure*.

Syntax:

`IsButtonDown<Button: "ButtonName">`

These buttons are current supported:

* **"Menu"**
* **"Play/Pause"**
* **"Select"**
* **"ArrowUp"**
* **"ArrowDown"**
* **"ArrowRight"**
* **"ArrowLeft"**

The arrow buttons are only supported when a keyboard is connected to the AppleTV.

For swipe directions use *Swiped*.
