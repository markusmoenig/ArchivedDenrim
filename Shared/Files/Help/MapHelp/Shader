## Shader

A **Shader** creates a reference to a given shader in Denrim.

Basic Syntax:

`shaderId = Shader<Name: "ShaderName">`

Optionas:

* **BehaviorId** (BehaviorId), binds a behavior to the shader, for example <BehaviorId: boxBehavior>, the shader will than have access to all the variables of the given behavior, see the shader documentation.

* **Area** ("Full|Canvas"), defines the working rectangle of the shader. "Full" (the default) passes the whole viewport size to the shader, "Canvas" limits the shader to the current canvas area.
