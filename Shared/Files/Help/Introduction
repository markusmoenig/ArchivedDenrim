# Introduction

Denrim is a 2D game creator for the Apple Metal ecosystem (macOS, iOS, tvOS). It uses a unique text based approach to describe everything you need for a 2D game, the basic building blocks are *map* and *behavior* files.

## Map Files

Map files define scenes (or levels / menus) in your game. You can import resources like images and audio files and reference them in *Map* files, along with various other meta data you need for your game (like shapes and shaders). The ultimate output of a map file is a scene, which references all layered visual data.

## Behavior Trees

*Behavior* files assign behavior to game objects using easy to use, text based behavior trees. Behavior files and map files interact, as any data inside a map file can be bound to a variable in a behavior tree.

The default starting point for any game is your **Game** behavior file. Typically in it's "init" tree it will call *SetScene<>* which activates the first map based scene in the game.

## Shaders

Metal shaders can be live coded in Denrim and shader variables can be automatically bound to behavior trees variables, making it very easy to sync the visual output of shaders to your game logic.
