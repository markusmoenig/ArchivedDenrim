## Audio

**Audio** references an audio file you imported into Denrim by name.

By default audio id's are local to the current map file, i.e. they stop when a new map file is loaded. You can create global audio ids with the *Global* option, this will play the audio independently from the map file and until you call **StopAudio** for the id.

Syntax:

`audioId = Audio<Name: "AudioName">`

Options

* **Global** (true/false), makes the audio id global, i.e. it will play independent from the current map file and until you call **StopAudio**. Default is false.
* **Loops** (Int), the number of loops the audio plays. A value of 0 (the default) means it plays exactly one time, enter higher numbers for a specific amount of loops. A negative number will play the audio id an unlimited amount of time.

You can play audio ids via the **PlayAudio** instruction in behavior files and stop them via **StopAudio**.
