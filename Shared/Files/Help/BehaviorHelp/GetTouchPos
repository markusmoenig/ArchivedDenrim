## GetTouchPos

*GetTouchPos* returns *Success* if a touch operation is in progress, otherwise the node returns *Failure*.

A touch operation means the following:

* **macOS**: The left mouse button is pressed
* **iOS**: The user is touching the display

Additionally, if a touch operation is in progress, *GetTouchPos* will write the position into a variable.

Syntax:

`GetTouchPos<Variable: VariableName>`

VariableName has to be a *Float2* variable.

If you are only interested if a touch operation is in progress without receiving the position you can also use *HasTouch*.
